I defined our sum function to carry a partial total as a second parameter
so I could illustrate how to use accumulators to build values. The sum
function can also be written without an accumulator. Can you do it?

defmodule MyList do
  def sum(list), do: _sum(list)

  # private methods
  defp _sum([]), do: 0
  defp _sum([ head | tail ]), do: head + _sum(tail)
end
